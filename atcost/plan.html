            <h2>1. Calculate Net income</h2>
            <p>Net income is the amount earned less any taxes. For a college student it can also include money received from grants, scholarships, loans, or assistance from parents. If you have a fixed wage them calculating net income for the month is simple. If you work on an hourly basis, we will need to find an average amount of income.</p>

        <section class="step2">
            <h2>2. List Monthly Expenses</h2>
            <p>Common expenses for the average college student can include school supplies, rent, groceries, dining, household items, transportation, utilities, insurance, loan payments and then entertainment. This is not an all-inclusive list, during the first meeting we will discuss the expenses that the client has each month.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="step3">
            <h2>3. Organize Expenses Between Fixed and Variable</h2>
            <p>This will be done in the software during the initial client meeting. Fixed expenses are items that cannot be avoided or easily minimized. For example, rent, groceries, and transportation. Variable expenses are more optional such as entertainment, dining, and travel. A discussion will be held about what the client believes is there personal fixed and variable expenses. This determination will be helpful in the proceeding step.</p>

            <h2>4. Determine Monthly Costs</h2>
            <p>Once all expenses have been determined, a list will be made to represent all expenses that are normal for the client and the amount that is expected for a month. For items that are more variable, an estimate will be made for the first month of the budget.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="step5">
            <h2>5. Adjust as Needed</h2>
            <p>For the best results, we suggest each client uses our expense tracker so that at the end of the month expected versus actual costs can be compared and adjusted. Sometimes the amount spent will need to be adjusted if the client is unhappy with the amount spent. As each month goes by, the estimates will become more accurate as more data is obtained.</p>
