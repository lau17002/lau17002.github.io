        Mission Statement <br><br>
        We want to help individuals set up a budget that will help them to save for an item that they want, or to make sure that they are not spending more than their income. Our goal is to help customers understand their main expenses and how to reduce them appropriately in the future. After their package expires, we want customers to continue to use the software provided with their new skills to continue saving! <br> <br>
        Customer Use <br><br>
        Once an account is created, customers have access to an expense tracker, savings total, budget software, and consulting services. These budgets are personalized to the client and their specific income and expense types. They can either create this on their own with the aid of the Budget Software or they can have a consultant assigned to them for a more personalized experience. <br>

      <h3>Budget Plan</h3>
      <p>
        1. Calculate Net income <br>
        Net income is the amount earned less any taxes. For a college student it can also include money received from grants, scholarships, loans, or assistance from parents. If you have a fixed wage them calculating net income for the month is simple. If you work on an hourly basis, we will need to find an average amount of income. <br> <br>
        2. List Monthly Expenses <br>
        Common expenses for the average college student can include school supplies, rent, groceries, dining, household items, transportation, utilities, insurance, loan payments and then entertainment. This is not an all-inclusive list, during the first meeting we will discuss the expenses that the client has each month.<br> <br>
        3. Organize expenses between fixed and variable<br>
        This will be done in the software during the initial client meeting. Fixed expenses are items that cannot be avoided or easily minimized. For example, rent, groceries, and transportation. Variable expenses are more optional such as entertainment, dining, and travel. <br> <br>
        4. Determine monthly costs <br>
        Once all expenses have been determined, a list will be made to represent all expenses that are normal for the client and the amount that is expected for a month. For items that are more variable, an estimate will be made for the first month of the budget. <br> <br>
        5. Adjust<br>
        For the best results, we suggest each client uses our expense tracker so that at the end of the month expected versus actual costs can be compared and adjusted. Sometimes the amount spent will need to be adjusted if the client is unhappy with the amount spent. As each month goes by, the estimates will become more accurate as more data is obtained. <br> <br>
